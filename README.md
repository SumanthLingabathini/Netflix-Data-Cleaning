Netflix Data Cleaning Project 🎬
I worked on a Netflix dataset to clean and prepare it for analysis using Python and Pandas in Jupyter Notebook. The main goal was to make the raw data consistent, complete, and ready for deeper exploration.

Data Cleaning Process
I started by removing unnecessary columns and renaming the remaining ones to make them easier to understand. Then, I dropped duplicate entries to ensure each record was unique. Missing values were carefully handled, and I standardized formats across all columns to maintain consistency.

Key Results
After cleaning, the dataset was reduced from X rows to Y rows, with all missing values addressed and standardized column formats. The final version was fully ready for exploratory data analysis and visualization.

What I Learned
Going through the data cleaning process reinforced how crucial it is to have structured and reliable data. It also made analysis and visualization faster, clearer, and more meaningful.
